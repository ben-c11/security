Kioptrix level 1 VulnHub; tcm-sec.com/kioptrix instead

Ip of kioptrix - 172.16.227.128

arp-scan -l #look for VMWare


Netdiscover 47.00.00

Need our ip address in kali; run ifconfig
192.168.57.4 	255.255.255.0


netdiscover -r 192.168.57.0/24

Ignore .1 and .2; therefore PCS Systemtechnik, 192.168.57.3 (close to ours) is the VM culprit.
.134 = vid

nmap (network mapper) - scans for open ports. It is meant to be stealthy, in the 3 way handshake of TCP connection (SYN SYNACK ACK) however it isn't stealthy now and you can be picked up. It carries out SYN receives ACK and nmap sends back RST instead to reset - never made a connection to port.

	nmap -T4 -p- -A 172.16.227.128

Speed: (slow) 1-5 (fast); 
-p-: want to scan all ports. If we miss this out then it defaults to scanning top 1000. If u wanna scan certain ports: -p 80,443,53
-A : all info: OS version, version, fingerprinting etc...


UDP scan
		nmap -T4 -sU -p 172.16.227.128

-p because it makes it scan the top 1000 ports b/c UDP is connectionless protocol & takes ages to scan

59.00.00
nmap -help good to know
sV probe

Remove -A and running -p- is quicker than the otherway aroud. Once open ports foun, you can put the numbers in to the -p as before and perform a -A on those. Scripting here! Scripting can do speeeeed. Or you can do other things as u go.
Probably doing scans while doing OSINT as we did earlier.

Now scans are done u can look at open ports! We will now work on the ports and try to find exploits for the ports, we'll go and look into these. Look into the nmap -help and play around with different parameters and run it against the machine - it's your lab time! Make the most of it!!



	
	1.04.18 Enumerating HTTP/HTTPS
	
Ports that are interesting as an attacker:
80 443		139 445

Not usually remote code execution (RCE) on port 22 ssh i.e. no shell back. Not common to ssh.

Low-hanging fruit is best! Get used to methodology
Investiate 80 443 and potentially 139.

First step, go to website IP --> Also https://IP b/c port 443. 

- If you find a default web page e.g. the apache page seen at box IP, this is a finding. It offers insight into the web server, RHEL and the client hygiene (poor if the port is just open!)
- Bad links also bad! See Kali notes 404 page information disclosure (extra unnec info)


	1.13.10 Nikto - web vuln scanner
	
Sometime websites have good security and autoblocks nikto scans!

	nikto -h http://IP
	
-h = host



	1.19.20 More enumeration
	
dirbuster, dirb, gobuster - directory buster tools

	dirbuster&
	
Run dirbuster as kali user. Put in http://IP:PORT
Browse files > / > usr > share > wordlist > dirbuster > directory-list small.txt (if not finding much, go to medium)
Put Threads to ~ 100 which worked for me. 200 was timing out too much

- You can view the pages it's seen! 200 = OK 400 response code = not found 300 = redirect 500 = server error
- Pages viewed by tree; open in browser and check webalyzer 2.01. Take notes on this.
Once results back, dig through most of the folders, looking for stuff that seems interesting/juicy
1.25.00
If there is a web page, you can use burp and it's always work viewing page source code. You can look for comments, passwords, user accounts etc that may be in the source that shouldn't be



-----
1.33.00

Take on board the methodologies; you can use different tools & software, you can come across different ports or vulns etc but always develop your methodology.
Basics when looking at a website: service version information, backend directories, source code, potential vulnerability scanning w/ Nikto and any other info - wapplyzer

		1.34.30 Enumerating SMB


SMB = File Share Protocol -
Metasplot - msfcoonsole
Meta does Exploits, auxiliary (scanning & enum), post (post exploitation, i.e. after exploiting a machine), payloads.


	> 'search smb' in metasploit
	
found: auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version 

In terminal:
	use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
	
	or
	
	use <number>
	
	
Now using the program, you can type info to get info on the module.
1.42.00
	options - gives options!
	

RHOST = Remote host. The target. One host only accepted
RHOSTS = Can accept multiple targets. In smb_version we can use CIDR notation e.g. /24 to scan a whole range.

	set RHOST <IP> --> set RHOST 

	run
	
	
	
BE VERY GOOD WITH FINDING & LOGGING INFORMATION/ENUMERATING!!

	1.44.50 smbclient
	
tries to connect to the file share anonymously. Potentially see files!

	smbclient -L \\\\172.16.227.128\\
	or
	smbclient -L \\172.16.227.128
	(-L = list)
character escaping
ENTER as pwd

This lists any file shares found, one of which was ADMIN$

 	smbclient \\\\172.16.227.128\\ADMIN$
 	
 ENTER doesn't work as pwd. Try the other fileshare
 
 	smbclient \\\\172.16.227.128\\IPC$
 
Pwd successful.
1.47.00

	> help 
lists all stuff

- See notes in kioptrix directory 



	1.49.00 Enumerating SSH
	
Trying to connect to SSH; just trying to connect to SSH with a pwd attempt, it's classed as exploitation so don't do it

	ssh 172.16.227.128 (usual way to do it)
	
Because the box is running old OS you get error no matching key exchange method found
	ssh 172.16.227.128 -oKexAlgorithms=+<one of the key suggestions>
	
Sometimes a banner is exposed when connecting via SSH. In this case, there wasn't. Dead end as pwd needed

--------------------------------------------------

		1.53.13 Researching Potential Vulnerabilities
		
- mod_ssl/2.8.4; 80/443  potentially vulnerable to OpenFuck exploit
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/764 		Buffer Overflow
https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck - Actually works!

- Apache httpd 1.3.20 
Can check CVE, reds are critical. 


2.04.20

Can also search offline using searchsploit - don't be too specific e.g. looking for Samaba 2.21 exploit use:
	
		searchploit Samba 2

Here we can look through for remote code execution & at least find an exploit name or get an idea.

We just researching!

2.08.43		Our notes so far

See kioptrix.ctd in Kali for project notes & structure



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	2.11.17		Scanning with Nessus


Vulnerability scanner. Potentially used first! Takes time so while running try find info.

nessus download - tenable

home/kali/Downloads - depackage files -i = install
	dpkg -i Nessus-10.6.1-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb
	
Start with /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
and go to https://kali:8834/ to configure your scanner

Activation code: MAHN-RSKK-2F3X-L3JH-VULE

2:15.00 Nessus installed
You can scan an IP and get back a lot of information regarding vulnerabilities. We can also run advanced scans.

2.22.00 Nessus Results
Go to Scans > Settings > Disable grouping to see by severity.
Add notes from here on all the issues.

Take note of Critical and Mediums.

You can download the nessus file & convert it to an excel file.
Never trust your vuln scanner -> check it all yourself, don't report straight from Nessus, get info from a credible source.
