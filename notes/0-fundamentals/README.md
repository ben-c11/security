Here are the some of the documented fundamentals I have gained 
experience with to ensure I have a decent base knowledge prior to 
proceeding.

I had already covered multiple of these topics by this point in
my development. For example I had exposure to python when I enrolled
in the MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.
Seeing objects in python was not new as I have experience with other
OOP languages and have encounterd objects in my JavaScript projects.
The shoe budget tool was an opportunity to see how it all worked 
together in python.

I also have been running linux as my main OS for a little while and
so I am comfortable with the basics of the cli however I did learn
about multiple other tools and this served as refresher for commands
I had forgotten about.
