Subnetting

ifconfig:
inet = ipv4 - made up of 32 bits (each part is 8 bits)
2^32 = 4 billion possible IP addresses.

inet6 = ipv6
128 bits
2^128 = LOTS

Layer 3 = IP = routing



How are we still using IPv4 if there is no address space anymore?
NAT - network address translation: assinging private ips that link to your IP facing internet
Anything starting with 192.168 likely private - not internet facing

4 classes of IPs
Class	Network num	network mask	No. Networks	No Hosts
A	10.0.0.0	255.0.0.0	  126		16,646,144
B	172.16.0.0 	
	  to		255.255.0.0	  16,383	 65,024
	172.31.0.0

C	192.168.0.0
	    to
	192.168.255.255	 255.255.255.0	 2,097,151	 254

Loopback 127.0.0.0
	    to
	 127.0.0.7	255.255.255.0
	 
Large corp use 10. addressess to have small no network but large no hosts, coversely 192.168 is private home netowrk/small business, large no networks but small no hosts.



		MAC Addresses
		
In linux, it's called the ether in ifconfig. Physical address. NIC has MAC address

Layer 2 - switching

eg 00:0c:29:0a:42:05
6 pairs of 2

Take first 3 pairs and can go to MAC lookup





57:45		TCP UDP & three way handshake

Layer 4 - Transport layer

TCP vs UDP

Transmission control procol vs 		User Datagram Protocol
(Connection protocol)			(conectionless protocol)
- High reliabilty 			VOIP, streaming, DNS
website/ HTTPS, HTTP, ftp ssh

Scan both these protocols - TCP is most common

TCP works in a 3 way handshake:
Send SYN packet, receive SYN ACK > send ACK packet
	hi		acknowledge	start covo (connect to port)
	
port 443 - webpage





1:03:00		Common ports and protocols 


TCP						UDP
21 - FTP					DNS 53
22 SSH						DHCP 67, 68	  
23 TELNET					TFTP 69
25 SMTP						SNMP 161
53 DNS
80 HTTP/HTTPS 443
POP3 110
SMB 139 + 445
IMAP 143

ftp - file transfer protocol. get file off server.
telnet - able to log into machine remotely. All cleartext
Ssh - encrypted version of telnet
SMTP pop3 imap - all mail related
DNS - relsove ip addresses to name
HTTP/HTTPS - websites secure n not
SMB - later versions include 445. File shares SAMBA - pentesters like these (wanacry virus MS17-010 - eternal) Opened frequently

DNS in udp is both protocols
DHCP - associates you with an IP address dynamically from a pool for x amount of time, static ip assignment
TFTP - trivial file transfer protocol using udp instead of tcp
SNMP - simple network management protocol




1:09:00			OSI Model

1 Physical - data cables, CAT6			Please
2 Data - Switching, MAC addresses		Do
3 Network - IP, routing				Not
4 Transport - TCP/UDP				Throw
5 Session - Session Management			Sweetcorn
6 Presentation - WMV, JPEG, MOV (media!)	Pizza
7 Application - HTTP, SMTP			Away

Why important?
When data is sent, it moves from the physical to the application layer. When received, it goes from application to the physical.
When troubleshooting start at physical 



1:14:40			Subnetting part 1

ifconfig - netmask = subnet 255.255.255.0 /24 network
/24 is the number of bits i.e. number of 1's across the whole thing

Subnet all bits 8bits (ones n zeros!)

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
1    1  1 1  1 1 1 1	= 255 		(all x4 for x.x.x.x octet)

Subnetting fills up the bits similar to IP but MUST fill from the top-most bits i.e 128 down and never randomly or from bottom


Host 2^8 goes down by one power when a 1 is filled in which reduces the number of hosts. 
The amount of devices on your private network is governed by the subnet mask 256 = 2^8 = common for houses or small business

Possiblity of 32 bits

Hosts  128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1
Subnet 128  192 224 240 248 252 254 255

bits  subnet
8     255.0.0.0
16    255.255.0.0
24    255.255.255.0
32    255.255.255.255

Cheat sheet pls - 1.27.00

Larger company needs lower than /24 so /16 or /8 or /11.
Companies can have subnetted sub networks to allow for e.g. telephone site

Subtract 2 from hosts to get real number.

Why no 1 and why IP 1?? -- becasuse 255*2 = 510.
you have 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255 AND
