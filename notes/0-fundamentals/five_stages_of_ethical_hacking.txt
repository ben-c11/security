#6.22.30 Five stages of ethical hacking

Reconnaissance - Active & Passive:
  Passive: LinkedIn, Googling them, FB
  Active: Scanning & enumeration; use tools to get stuff
  
Scanning and Enumeration:
  Nmap, Nessus, Nikto
  Actively scan against a client; open ports, vulnerabilities
  - Enum: looking at items and trying to find ones with value, e.g. web server on port 80 running apache 1.2 (old software) and then find exploits regarding that software
  
  
Gaining Access (Exploitation)
  - Run exploit to gain access to a network or machine.
  - Also scan and enumerate more


Maintaining Access
 - Afer PC turned off or network down, how can we still be persistent?
 
 
 Covering Tracks
 - Delete logs and any malware you used, any accounts created. Cleaning up
 
 
 
 
	## 6.27.50 Passive Recon

Physical/Social - Physical going on site, social - phising, vishing (voice scam to get info), smishing (texts SMS), spear phishing (highly personalised phising attempt)

 - Local information: drone recon, satellite images, buidling layout(badge readers, smoking areas, security, fencing
 - Job information: Employees (name, job title, phone number, manager); pictures(badge photos, desk photos, computer photos)
 
 
Web/Host assessment:

  Target validation - validate the correct target so u don't attack another IP address by accident! WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon.
  Finding subdomains - Google Fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh 
  Fingerprinting - What web servers are they running, what ports are open, what are they running on those ports? FTP? What version of FTP...: Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, NetCat
  Data Breahes: Past incidents that have leaked info for companiesL HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo
  
  
	6.35.20 Identifying target
Use bugcrowd as a client; bug bounty 

Bugcrowd.com > Programs 

Check rules of engagements - Don't exceed these; Stay within the scope!!!!


	6.39.08	Discovering Email addresses
	
Email OSINT - trying to find someone's email address and the format, maybe make an educated guess

Hunter.io - type in company name; identifies an email pattern - sign in gmail.

phonebook.cz - listsdomains, emails and URLs: use these with credential stuffing or trying these against passwords

Voilanorbet.com - similar to hunter.io

Clearbit connect - used in chrome (or use extension) - discovers stuff u might not see anywhere else! Finds stuff from linkedIn


- Typically Google search a person, or company; verify the email u found or approximated - use emailhippo to verify or email-checker.net


6.52.30 - Don't underestimate forgot passwords:

Try g-email address and see if it's validated by trying to sign in. Try forgot password to h*****@tc****.com; try find an email with these credentials.

6.55.00- Password OSINT: Gathering breached credentials: BreachParse


Go to Github.com/maverickadams
 - 44GB big file! Can download but don't need to!
 - download to /opt in Kali
 
 Data file in BP (breachParse) file; Hundreds of files, BP searches through all the breached data. Read README to find out how to use and check out code.
 
 6.58.00
 cd /opt/breach-parse
 ./breach-parse.sh @tesla.com telsa.txt
 
 - Going to grab any credentials with @tesla.com domain in the database and return them along with the passwords.
 Program breaks it down to 3 files: password file, username file and master file with both in.
 Look for repeat offenders - check and see if it's the same pattern as you noticed from before e.g. firstname.lastname@domain.com
 - You can try credential stuffing on a tesla login page; credential stuffing = trying out passwords found, i.e. you already 'know' the password. Try make mods in capitalisation in text.
 - Password spraying: trying all of the known usernames/emails and trying passwords against them
 
 
 
	
	7.02.20 	Hunting Breached Credentials
	

Retain methodology! Dw about a single website being taken down!
Dehashed.com - costs money!

Can search via email, phone, domain, name, username, IP, VIN, password! If password is unique then u can narrow it down to an account; if that unique password is tied to another account then u can see their personal account - or other tied account! 
Trying to relate other accounts together!!

- Dehash password? Try to link email found; take note of all emails and passwords. Try the passwords and link to other accounts!
- Try the hash, maybe it's been broken before.

	
7.11.35 Hashes.org
Can try to crack a hash! Or just try Google.
Adobe Database also mebs has breached hash info.
